    <p class="typewriter">Hello, All my name is Rami I'm 24 years old I'm a graduated student 2021 as Computer Science I joined this
         course to evaluate my inherent abilities, Although I have accumulated a strong foundational knowledge
        in this domain, I think the best way to move forward would be to get practical working experience in 
        an established platform and of course meeting a new programmers this course is going to help me alot during my learing Journey.
